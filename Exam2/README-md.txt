# Project Title

This project is the solution to Exam 2, which asks to create a program that converts US Dollars to Canadian Dollars.

## Example Output

![Sample Output](README.jpg)

## Analysis Steps

I began with getting the GUI appearance set up similar to the example given. Once I was satisfied with it's appearance, I started programming the functionality.

### Design

While my programs through Chapter 16 have made use of at least one additional class to demonstrate proper encapsulation, I decided to keep the program simple given the time constraint and the simplicity of the sample.


### Testing

1. Does the application run without error?

```
Pass
```

2. Do the nodes appear and allow interaction?

```
Pass
```

3. Does the 'Convert' button throw an error when the fields are empty?

```
Pass
```

4. Does the 'Convert' button produce an output in the Canadian Dollar textfield if the US Dollar textfield is populated with a number?

```
Pass
```

5. Does the program throw an error if a non-number is entered into the US Dollar textfield?

```
Pass
```
