# Grading Notes

Code looks great. The Radix is very complicated and I understand it taking up quite a bit of time. I do believe it is experience that will benefit you many times in the future.

I cannot test without re-assembling the complete project, that is why I request that the complete project be loaded to GitHub.

# Markdown file
