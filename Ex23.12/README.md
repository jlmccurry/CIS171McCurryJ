## Analysis Steps

The exercise was to create a program that demonstrates a radix sort by sorting a list of 1,000,000 random integers.

### Design

The conditions of program were:

1. The program must generate 1,000,000 random integers
2. To perform a radix sort to put the random integers in ascending order

Given the scale of 1,000,000 integers, I started with 100 instead. I began by studying a radix sort and reading as much material on it as I could. From there, I started coding what I thought was a representation of a radix sort. I realized that my solution was growing to be quite excessive, so I set it aside and went back to studying the radix sort in the interest of getting down to the bare function of the algorithm. I went back to coding the sort and was finally able to accomplish it. That is really understating the hours I put in to make it function, much to my own detriment.

I included a shorter ArrayList to actually demonstrate the sort, as well as some verbage to help illustrate what the code is doing.

### Testing

Does the program compile?

```
Pass
```

Does the program generate 1,000,000 random numbers.

```
Pass
```

Does the program perform a radix sort?

```
Pass
```

Do the random integers, after the sort, appear in the properly sorted order?

```
Pass
```
