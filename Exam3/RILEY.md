# Grading Notes

Very nice work.

The array data should be exaclty the same for each sort in order to ensure a valid comparison. We cannot generate a new array of random
numbers for each sort - what if the numbers randomly come out in almost sorted order? We should generate each size array once, then copy it for
each sort. This ensures a valid comparison.
