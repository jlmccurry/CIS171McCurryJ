# Exercise 30.3

This project is the solution to Exercise 30.3

## Example Output

![Sample Output](README.jpg)

## Analysis Steps

The exercise was to 15.13 using a thread to animate a flag being raised. 

### Design

Design was in two phases - the first to get listing 15.13 functional, and then to impliment the use of threads. The program currently exhibits different behavior with each run. The flags will either be fixed side by side and no path generated or started, one flag will animate, or both will animate. 

### Testing

Does the program compile?

```
Pass
```

Does the program display two flags?

```
Pass
```

Do the flags animate?

```
Pass w/ conditions
```
