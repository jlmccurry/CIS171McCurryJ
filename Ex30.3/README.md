# Exercise 30.3

This project is the solution to Exercise 30.3

## Example Output

![Sample Output](README.jpg)

## Analysis Steps

The exercise was to 15.13 using a thread to animate a flag being raised

### Design

As of the due date 4/10/2018 this program is only partially functional. Inserting values works. Searching for values always returns a success, and deleting does not work at all. To my own detriment Exercise 23.12 received most of my attention, and Exercise 24.7 suffered. I will continue to work after the due date to get it functional.

### Testing

Does the program compile?

```
Pass
```

Does the program display the LinkedList

```
Pass
```

Does the program allow insertion of values to the LinkedList

```
Pass
```

Does the program successfully search for a value in the LinkedList

```
Fail
```

Does the program successfully delete a value from the LinkedList

```
Fail
```

Does the program print out the proper number of prime values added after reading from the file?

```
Pass
```
