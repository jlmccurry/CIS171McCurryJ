# Grading Notes

Excellent implementation. In the textbook, note the use of the runlater to ensure running on the same thread as javafx.


# GitHub setup

Still  have to re-create project to run, since you are only uploading pieces of your project to GitHub. It takes quite a while, considering there are many to grade.
