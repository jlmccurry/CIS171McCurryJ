# Project Title

This project is the solution to Exercise 22.14

## Example Output

![Sample Output](README.jpg)

## Analysis Steps

The exercise was to create a program that measures the execution time for finding all the prime numbers for numbers less than 8000000, 10000000, 12000000, 14000000, and 16000000 using three different algorithms.

### Design

For the sake of simplicity, I opted for sticking to the Java console. I encapsulated each algorithm in it's own method, then went about organizing the data into a table.


### Testing

Does the program compile and run?

```
Pass
```

Does the program generate prime numbers?

```
Pass
```

Do each of the algorithm methods work and report back execution time elapsed?

```
Pass
```

Does the information display in a table?

```
Pass
```
